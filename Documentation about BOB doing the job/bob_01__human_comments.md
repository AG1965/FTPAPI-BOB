# BOB analyzes the application

We started with the assumption, that we might be a young developer and do not know anything about this library and want to know what it is and does.

I put BOB in "Ask"-mode and told him in german "Analysiere diese Anwendung" (which means what you guess) and i could watch BOB doing his job [telling me what he's doing](bob_01a_thinking.md).

I told the audience about my poorest possible prompt and that there is the magic button to enhance my prompt, but it wasn't necessary!

I allowed BOB to read the files he wanted to read, he started with the `README.MBR`, followed by the `LICENCSE.MBR` (BOB truly is an IBMer 😉), then `PACKAGE.MBR`, `CHANGELOG.MBR` and `VERSION.MBR`.

Then he told me that he would like to examine the `FTPAPI_H.MBR` and core implementation to understand the architecture better.

Interestingly, he reads only the first 200 lines of `FTPAPIR4.MBR`.
(BOB seems to be able to read max. 1,000 lines in one go).

He kind of entertains me betweeen file reads.

And then he came up with the [Analysis](bob_01b_Task_completed.md) - in german, the language i asked him in.

And this analysis seems to be nothing less than perfect! It made me want to use this stuff in one of my projects!

After the "Stammtisch" i decided that this is a wonderful project and continued in english to address a larger audience.
