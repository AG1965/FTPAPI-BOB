# BOB's modernization suggestions

Then i asked BOB "Was schlägst Du zur Modernisierung dieses Codees vor?" (German, with a typo, translates to "What do you suggest for modernizing this code?").

He then started to tell me his [thinkings in german](bob_02a_thinking.md), which surely makes it a bit harder for you if you don't understand german, sorry for that, but it's technical enough that i'm confident everyone will get what's going on.

I didn't want to waste bobcoins for repeating this in english.

Actually, he started to present his "Task completed", but due to technical problems with Teams i had to interrupt him.
[He obviously wasn't finished yet.](bob_02b_Task_completed.md)

After restarting Teams i continued. No more thinking, he repeated the [output](bob_02c_Task_completed.md), more than 300 lines in total.

1A - I can totally agree with going totally free.

1B - i have to confess that i don't have the proper free syntax for procedure pointers at hand, but let's trust him for now and go on.

2A - 1,000 lines is too big... Well, he didn't see our programs. OK, he might be right.

2B - Without seeing the original code, the "Objektorientierter Ansatz" (Object-oriented approach) looks good and like an improvement.

3A - are you kidding me? That is not RPG!

3B - one can argue about that. I could live with both, with a slight preference for the original version.

4A - looks good
4B - looks also nice

5A - i'm not sure whether BOB didn't mix up some things here, but maybe i'm wrong.

5B - without checking, it looks good.

6A - a mockup FTP server is surely a good idea; he would have to elaborate to check the quality of the suggestion

6B - i like the joblog. Error log files are also nice; a mixture would be nice. I can force him on the way.

7A - why not. Not sure, whether VS Code understands that, but we will see.

7B - i like OpenAPI/Swagger, but for this program? Not really.

8A - would be nice; interested what he would suggest. (I'd suggest to the programmer: learn bash.)

8B - No, this is a FTP library. F - T - P, nothing else.

9A - nobody asked for that, but OK.
9B - nice idea; but pretty useless, i assume.
9C - i'm no docker expert, but i don't think that this makes any sense at all.

10A - the first prototype looks interesting, but the second? There might be FTP-Servers secured by OAuth, but i haven't met one yet.

The Roadmap looks nice, and i hope to be able to follow it up to step 8.

Steps 9 to 12 - i have my doubts.

[But let's continue the journey.](bob_03__human_comments.md)
