# BOB tryout - analyzing and modernizing Scott Klement's FTPAPI

This is a human typing, all files without the word "human" in their name contain 100% BOB output.
You can see what changed in the source code by going thru the commits after each Sub-Task.

I work in a banking environment, where we are not thinking about using BOB in the cloud. We are interested in an OnPrem solution. Nevertheless, we are curious about BOB.

So i tested BOB at home on my private PC with my hobby projects, and, in the middle of our Austrian [common.at](https://www.common.at) "Web-Stammtisch" (which one can translate as "Web Regular's Table"), a Microsoft Teams meeting, [Dirk Neumann](https://neumann-software.de/) presented slides with his or Tim Rowe's experiences with BOB, but somehow the 42 people missed seeing the real thing, so i came up with the idea to test BOB live with a popular open source library that Scott Forstie hasn't replaced with a SQL Service / SYSTOOL (I guess i have to add: yet) - Scott Klement's FTPAPI.

I downloaded it from <https://www.scottklement.com/ftpapi/>, extracted it, `git init` made it the repo you are seeing now, and did the initial commit with original unchanged files and started to share my screen.

In no way i want to correct Scott Klement, i'm more than thankful to one of the first persons who actually published his code as open source, his excellent code, with instructions, samples, often better than vendors taking money. Thank you, Scott!
So it's no wonder, when I think of IBM i Open Source, there's one name that comes to mind first: Scott Klement.

This is just to test BOB's capabilities with an easy to get open source library that most people might know and even might find useful today. And it's not that brand new, there is fixed format code, so BOB might have something to do.
